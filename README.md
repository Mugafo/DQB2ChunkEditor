## DQB2 Chunk Editor

Dragon Quest Builders 2 Map Chunk Editor based on the map flattener from https://github.com/turtle-insect/DQB2

Currently tested with the first chunk and first layer.

Still need to add chunk and layer selections and I need to export block data for colors and tool shapes.

"Items" are way more difficult than simple block and I am still researching the data structure. Looks like there are a lot of different things that go into those, placement direction, shadows, block tile effects.

Backups are not made when editing, so make sure to keep a backup.
